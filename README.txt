SIF is a collection of high-level include scripts to make the
development of interactive features easy for the developer while
maintaining quality front-end gameplay for players.


To install:
	Simply put the folder into your Pawno/includes/ folder
	Then use this line in your gamemode to start using SIF:
		#include <SIF/SIF>

	If you like, you can move 'SIF.pwn out' of the SIF folder
	and into the includes folder so you just have to write:
		#include <SIF>

	The file 'SIF.pwn' is unlikely to change so feel free to
	put the file where you want to.
